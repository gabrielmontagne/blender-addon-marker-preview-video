= Maker Preview Video

If you're working on a long animation and would like to get a sense of rhythm and look, mark the frames you'd like to check with markers on the timeline, then search the `Preview from markers` operator.

The operator will generate images for each of the frames with markers.
If you also have a scene named _edit_, the addon will place the images as strips on its VSE.

When running the operator you'll see a dialog with the following options:

Override images:: if this is off, frames that have already been rendered will not be rendered again.
VSE target channel index:: the channel number on which to lay out the images strips.
Clean VSE channel:: if this is on, all the strips on the VSE target channel (se above) will be deleted before the new ones are laid out.

NOTE: if you have a `VERSION.txt` with a version number, this version will be interpolated in the marker preview path.
